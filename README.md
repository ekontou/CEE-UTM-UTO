You can practice with the algorithms we reviewed in class including the bisection method, the gradient descent method, and Dijkstra's algorithm. You can also find examples of calling solvers to determine the link flow distribution under user equilibrium and system optimum conditions. Last but not least, sustainable network problems are solved under system-optimized conditions.

Please reach out to Dr. Kontou with any questions.

Enjoy!
