This repository includes codes of concepts and algorithms taught in the CEE598 class on Urban Transportation Models at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. I offer coding application of the bisection method, the gradient descent method, and Dijkstra's algorithm. You can also find examples of calling solvers to determine the link flow distribution under user equilibrium and system optimum conditions for simple networks. Last but not least, a few sustainable network problems are solved under system-optimized conditions.

Please reach out to Dr. Eleftheria Kontou with any questions.

Enjoy!
